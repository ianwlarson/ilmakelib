Another build system. Sort-of

This is designed to be a helper library so that anyone can make a build system
that suits their needs _and_ program it in Python, taking full advantage of its
flexibility and modularity.

An example of how to use this library is available: https://github.com/ianwlarson/ilmakelib_example
